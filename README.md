# üßÆ Discrete Structures ‚Äì Algorithmic Exercises Overview

## üß† About the Course

**Discrete Structures (also known as Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science)** provides the mathematical foundation essential for understanding computation, data structures, algorithms, and systems design. It covers core topics like graph theory, set theory, combinatorics, logic, and recursion ‚Äî all vital for problem-solving in computer science.

In this course, students implement **algorithmic solutions** to classical problems, translating mathematical concepts into efficient, working C++ code.

## üß™ Types of Programming Assignments

### 1. **Graph Algorithms**
Students explore how discrete structures like graphs can represent real-world problems. Common tasks include:
- **Shortest path algorithms** (e.g., Bellman-Ford): Handle directed graphs, including negative weights, and compute optimal paths.
- **Hamiltonian cycles / TSP** (e.g., Bellman-Held-Karp): Solve combinatorial problems using dynamic programming with bitmasking.

### 2. **Combinatorics & Optimization**
Assignments challenge students to:
- Enumerate or generate combinations and permutations
- Optimize recursive solutions using memoization or bottom-up DP
- Model and solve NP-hard problems with approximations or exact methods

### 3. **Logic and Recursion**
Other exercises may involve:
- Boolean logic and propositional proofs
- Recursive functions with well-defined base and recursive steps
- Mathematical induction and formal reasoning
